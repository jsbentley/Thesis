I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the following people who have helped me to get to where I am:\\

First and foremost I am extremely grateful to my supervisors, Professor Chris Tinney and Associate Professor Sarah Martell for sharing their knowledge and steering my research. In particular I would like to thank Professor Tinney for his ability to repair computers at short notice, and Associate Professor Sarah Martell for constantly putting cyan everywhere.\\

Additionally I would like to thank Dr Duncan Wright for initially supervising my work and for spending many hours assisting me with technical issues. Dr Sanjib Sharma also deserves praise for adapting {\em Galaxia} to suit the needs of the photometric selection method of Chapter 2, and Dr Jeffrey Simpson for his assistance in database cross-matching. Professor Jeffrey Linsky for providing me with access to one of his papers. Dr Christoph Bergmann provided multiple opportunities to discuss the issues that arose in the development of the ISV analysis of Chapter 3, and Kirsten Banks for proof reading Chapter 1.\\

Lastly I would like to thank my friends and family. My mother for being an inspiration to persevere, no matter what happens. Tammy and James for distracting me when I needed a break. Lastly Zandra, for just being herself.
